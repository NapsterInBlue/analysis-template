============

Hey, thanks for opening this page! Let's build something cool.

Until we get a better idea of how much more work this project requires, feel free to reach out via Teams at **Doing Open Source**, or by `opening up an issue <https://git.rockfin.com/DataScienceWiki/ds-project-template/issues>`_.

In the meantime, giving the general `Data Science Contribution Guide <https://git.rockfin.com/pages/DataScienceWiki/Master/ContributionGuide/index.html>`_ a read might prove valueable!
